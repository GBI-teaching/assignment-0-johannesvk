# Assignment-0

We will walk through this assignment together in the first tutorial session. Afterwards you should be ready for the summer term :)

## Tasks
### 1. Join classroom
Your tutor will give you a link to this Assignment, when you follow this link you will automatically be added to the correct classroom. We will need your github username to correctly assign who did what later.
### 2. Create team for hand-ins
You will work on your Assignments in pairs of two students. To ensure that you always work in the same repositories one of you needs to create a team upon registration in github classroom, the other team mate needs to join that team. It is important that you do it that way, otherwise we will not be able to group you correctly.
