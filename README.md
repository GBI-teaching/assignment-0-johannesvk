# Assignment-0

We will walk through this assignment together in the first tutorial session. Afterwards you should be ready for the summer term :)

## Tasks
### 1. Join classroom
Your tutor will give you a link to this Assignment, when you follow this link you will automatically be added to the correct classroom. We will need your github username to correctly assign who did what later.
### 2. Create team for hand-ins
You will work on your Assignments in pairs of two students. To ensure that you always work in the same repositories one of you needs to create a team upon registration in github classroom, the other team mate needs to join that team. It is important that you do it that way, otherwise we will not be able to group you correctly.
### 3. Install the IDE
An IDE is a program that allows you to write code. For this course we will be working with Intellij which can be downloaded [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
### 4. Clone this repository
`git clone <>`
### 5. Read short introduction into github
GitHub is great!
### 6. Create Markdown files
Each team member should create a Markdown file which is called `<YourName>.md and enter the names of both team mates into that file.
### 7. Push the created files to this repository
Congrats, you finished your first Assignment :)
